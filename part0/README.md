# Part 0

Part 0 covers the Fundamentals of Web apps.

The author presents a simple application, where the user can insert text into an input field and that value is displayed in a list once submited, on the same page. This application is used to discuss the differences between the old web development techniques (completely server-side generated pages with reloads on every request) and new web development (application logic in the browser, component rendering).

In this part, the Developer Console and a few Sequence Diagrams are used to demonstrate what happens when a page is opened in the browser. The sequence of events is initiated with the HTML code passed to the browser. When that code is interpreted, the browser sends extra requests, to fetch css files and JS files. If the JS files received trigger more requests, the sequence goes on.

Other fundamental pieces of web applications are covered in a very practical way, including: 
* Document Object Model
* DOM manipulation
* CSS
* HTML
* HTTP protocol
* Event handlers
* AJAX
